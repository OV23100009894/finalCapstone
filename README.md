## Introduction. 
This Capstone Project focuses on enhancing a task management system for small businesses using Python. It employs lists, dictionaries, functions, and string handling to extend the system's functionality. The project aims to improve code readability, modularity, and efficiency through refactoring.

Key features of the project include:

    Registering users and adding tasks to the system.
    Viewing all tasks and tasks assigned to the current user.
    Preventing duplicate usernames during user registration.
    Providing options to mark tasks as complete or edit task details.
    Generating user-friendly reports on task and user statistics.

The significance of this project lies in its ability to streamline task management processes for small businesses, improving organization, efficiency, and accountability within teams. By implementing these enhancements, the project facilitates clearer task tracking, better user interaction, and simplified reporting, ultimately contributing to smoother workflow management and better decision-making.

Overall, this project serves as a practical exercise in code refactoring, demonstrating the importance of clean, modular, and efficient code in real-world applications.

## Installation
To install Python on your computer, follow these steps:

#### Download Python Installer:
    Go to the official Python website at https://www.python.org/. On the homepage, you'll find a "Downloads" section. Click on it to navigate to the downloads page.

#### Choose Python Version:
    On the downloads page, you'll see different versions of Python available for download. Typically, you'll want to download the latest stable version. At the time of             writing, it's Python 3.x. Python 2.x is no longer supported and should not be used for new projects.
#### Select Operating System:    Click on the appropriate link for your operating system. Python is available for Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions.

#### Download Installer:
    Once you've selected your operating system, you'll be directed to the download page for that platform. Click on the download link to start downloading the Python installer.

#### Run Installer:
    Once the installer is downloaded, locate the downloaded file and run it. Follow the instructions in the installation wizard to install Python on your computer.

#### Customize Installation (Optional):
    During the installation process, you may have the option to customize the installation settings. You can choose the installation directory, whether to add Python to the        system PATH (recommended), and which optional features to include.

#### Verify Installation:
    After the installation is complete, open a command-line interface (Terminal on macOS/Linux or Command Prompt on Windows) and type python --version to verify that Python is installed correctly. You should see the installed Python version printed to the console.

That's it! Python is now installed on your computer, and you can start writing and running Python code. You can also install additional packages using pip, Python's package manager, to extend Python's functionality as needed.
## Usage
Running Python code can be done in several ways depending on your specific needs and environment. Here are some common methods:

#### Using a Python Interpreter:
    You can run Python code interactively using a Python interpreter. Open your command-line interface (Terminal on macOS/Linux or Command Prompt on Windows), navigate to the directory containing your Python file (if necessary), and then type python followed by the name of your Python file:
This will execute the Python code in the specified file.

####Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
IDEs like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Atom provide a more feature-rich environment for writing and running Python code. You can open your Python file in the IDE, then use the built-in tools to run your code. Typically, there's a "Run" button or a keyboard shortcut (e.g., F5) to execute the code.

####Using Online Python Interpreters:
If you don't have Python installed on your local machine, or if you want to quickly test some code, you can use online Python interpreters like Repl.it, PythonAnywhere, or Google Colab. These platforms allow you to write and execute Python code directly in your web browser without needing to install anything locally.

####Using Jupyter Notebooks:
Jupyter Notebooks are an interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. You can run Python code in Jupyter Notebooks cell-by-cell, making it easy to experiment and iterate on your code.

####Using Python Shell (Interactive Mode):
You can also run Python code interactively in a Python shell by simply typing python in your command-line interface without specifying a file:
This will open a Python shell where you can type and execute Python commands one at a time.

Choose the method that best suits your needs and environment. Whether you're executing a single Python script, working on a larger project in an IDE, or experimenting with code in an interactive environment, Python provides flexible options for running your code.
